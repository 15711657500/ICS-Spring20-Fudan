## Coursework Guidelines

- You should use **verilog** as your programming language (**system verilog is not recommended**, and you should take your own risks if you insist on system verilog),  which our graders are based on.
- The first three assignments must be checked as scheduled in our syllabus, and each report can be delayed **no more than a week**. For the fourth assignment, you will not be required to finish, but we will grade on your accomplishments. 
- You'd better form a team as soon as possible (even in the first week), since `assignment-3` and `assignment-4` are designed as team project.
- Both English and Chinese are acceptable, and there will be no difference in terms of marking as long as you can make yourself clear with your report.
- Write clearly and succinctly. Highlight your answer and key result that is asked in the coursework requirements by using **Bold** font. You should take your own risk if you intentionally or unintentionally make the marking un-straightforward.
- Bonus mark (no more than 20%) will be considered if you make more in-depth exploration or further development that could in turn inspire the coursework to be a better one and show your understanding of the course material, this should only be the case given that you have already met the requirements.
- Please use the [issue system](https://github.com/SunflowerAries/ICS-Spring20-Fudan/issues) to ask questions about the coursework and course or discuss about the course content, use proper tags whenever possible, (e.g. `Arch/assignment-1`). In this case any questions answered by the instructor, TAs or others, and discussions will also be valuable for other students.
- If you find any mistakes in the coursework or the course website itself (e.g. typos) you are encouraged to correct it with a pull request, however, don't mix this kind of changes with your coursework submission pull request as stated in the following section.
- For any feedback, please consider emailing the TAs first.
